		Game instructions:

		The game starts after you press "New game". A riddle is given for you to solve and a security number, to keep track of your progress in the game.
		You will have to figure out the answer to the riddle and find that location to receive your next clue. When you are in front of the terminal you will
		have to enter your security number. If it is correct it will allow you to search for the next location, if not you will have to think harder.
